## Notes on using Survey123 to create self-assessment items in Storymaps.

### Survey design:
 - Use one of three item types: single choice
 - add conditional rules
 - provide user feedback in "Note" items (that display based on the conditional rules)

### Use URL parameters 
 - hide form components such as submit button, header, other items. Example: https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/92169135a854419e9641810144d97e9b?hide=submit,navbar,field:hideme is the same form (with URL parameters) as: https://survey123.arcgis.com/share/92169135a854419e9641810144d97e9b
