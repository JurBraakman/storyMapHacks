To be included in the StoryMap Expeditions listing at https://esriurl.com/expeditions, your expedition must meet the basic criteria:
1. Use a StoryMap to organize and initially present the expedition.
2. Use multiple 360 degree images (not video) or models with annotation and navigational linking.
3. The expedition should create a virtual field trip of a place or phenomenon that a K12 classroom would reasonably consider to be a destination for physical or virtual trips.
4. All expeditions should be age-appropriate.

A few tehnical approaches to expeditions:
Style 1: Link to 360 image from a picture
