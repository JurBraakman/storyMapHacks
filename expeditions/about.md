To be included in the StoryMap Expeditions listing at https://esriurl.com/expeditions, your expedition must meet the basic criteria:
1. Use a StoryMap to organize and initially present the expedition.
2. Use multiple 360° images, 360° videos, or models with annotation and navigational linking. Annotations internal to the media are critical for describing the scene to a learner.
3. The expedition should create a virtual field trip of a place or phenomenon that a K12 classroom would reasonably consider to be a destination for physical or virtual trips.
4. All expeditions should be age-appropriate, with all content publicly accessible.

A few tehnical approaches to expeditions:
Style 1: Link to 360° image from a picture
